  Provides a vSphere NAS datastore resource. This can be used to mount a NFS share as a datastore on a host.
---

# vsphere\_nas\_datastore

The `vsphere_nas_datastore` resource can be used to create and manage NAS
datastores on an ESXi host or a set of hosts. The resource supports mounting
NFS v3 and v4.1 shares to be used as datastores.

~> **NOTE:** Unlike [`vsphere_vmfs_datastore`][resource-vmfs-datastore], a NAS
datastore is only mounted on the hosts you choose to mount it on. To mount on
multiple hosts, you must specify each host that you want to add in the
`host_system_ids` argument.

[resource-vmfs-datastore]: /docs/providers/vsphere/r/vmfs_datastore.html

## Example Usage

The following example would set up a NFS v3 share on 3 hosts connected through
vCenter in the same datacenter - `esxi1`, `esxi2`, and `esxi3`. The remote host
is named `nfs` and has `/export/terraform-test` exported.

```hcl
variable "hosts" {
  default = [
    "esxi1",
    "esxi2",
    "esxi3",
  ]
}

data "vsphere_datacenter" "datacenter" {}

data "vsphere_host" "esxi_hosts" {
  count         = "${length(var.hosts)}"
  name          = "${var.hosts[count.index]}"
  datacenter_id = "${data.vsphere_datacenter.datacenter.id}"
}

resource "vsphere_nas_datastore" "datastore" {
  name            = "terraform-test"
  host_system_ids = ["${data.vsphere_host.esxi_hosts.*.id}"]

  type         = "NFS"
  remote_hosts = ["nfs"]
  remote_path  = "/export/terraform-test"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (String, required, forces new resource) The name of the datastore.
* `host_system_ids` - (List of strings, required) The managed object
  IDs of the hosts to mount the datastore on.
* `folder` - (String, optional) The relative path to a folder to put this
  datastore in. This is a path relative to the datacenter you are deploying the
  datastore to. Example: for the `dc1` datacenter, and a provided `folder` of
  `foo/bar`, Terraform will place a datastore named `terraform-test` in a
  datastore folder located at `/dc1/datastore/foo/bar`, with the final
  inventory path being `/dc1/datastore/foo/bar/terraform-test`.
* `type` - (String, optional, forces new resource) The type of NAS volume. Can
  be one of `NFS` (to denote v3) or `NFS41` (to denote NFS v4.1). Default:
  `NFS`.
* `remote_hosts` - (List of strings, required, forces new resource) The
  hostnames or IP addresses of the remote server or servers. Only one element
  should be present for NFS v3 but multiple can be present for NFS v4.1.
* `remote_path` - (String, required, forces new resource) The remote path of
  the mount point.
* `access_mode` - (String, optional, forces new resource) Access mode for the
  mount point. Can be one of `readOnly` or `readWrite`. Note that `readWrite`
  does not necessarily mean that the datastore will be read-write depending on
  the permissions of the actual share. Default: `readWrite`.
* `security_type` - (String, optional, forces new resource) The security type
  to use when using NFS v4.1. Can be one of `AUTH_SYS`, `SEC_KRB5`, or
  `SEC_KRB5I`.
* `tags` - (List of strings, optional) The IDs of any tags to attach to this
  resource. See [here][docs-applying-tags] for a reference on how to apply
  tags.

[docs-applying-tags]: /docs/providers/vsphere/r/tag.html#using-tags-in-a-supported-resource

~> **NOTE:** Tagging support is unsupported on direct ESXi connections and
requires vCenter 6.0 or higher.

## Attribute Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The managed object reference ID of the datastore.
* `accessible` - The connectivity status of the datastore. If this is `false`,
  some other computed attributes may be out of date.
* `capacity` - Maximum capacity of the datastore, in megabytes.
* `free_space` - Available space of this datastore, in megabytes.
* `maintenance_mode` - The current maintenance mode state of the datastore.
* `multiple_host_access` - If `true`, more than one host in the datacenter has
  been configured with access to the datastore.
* `uncommitted_space` - Total additional storage space, in megabytes,
  potentially used by all virtual machines on this datastore.
* `url` - The unique locator for the datastore.
* `protocol_endpoint` - Indicates that this NAS volume is a protocol endpoint.
  This field is only populated if the host supports virtual datastores. 

## Importing

An existing NAS datastore can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource via
its managed object ID, via the following command:

[docs-import]: https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html

```
terraform import vsphere_nas_datastore.datastore datastore-123
```

You need a tool like [`govc`][ext-govc] that can display managed object IDs.

[ext-govc]: https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/tree/master/govc

In the case of govc, you can locate a managed object ID from an inventory path
by doing the following:

```
$ govc ls -i /dc/datastore/terraform-test
Datastore:datastore-123
```
